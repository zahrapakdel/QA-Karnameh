# QA - Karnameh
This is a simple QA application developed for the interview process at Karnameh.
Here is a list of libraries that are used:
- ReactJS 
- Redux (state management)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- Axios (api calls)
- React-Router (routing)
- JSON-server (test api server)

To run a dev server, simply run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should also start the json server for api endpoints:
```bash
npm run server
```

If you want to use a different server, change the `apiUrl` variable in `api.js`.
